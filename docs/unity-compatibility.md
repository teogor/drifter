## How to Use

To ensure compatibility and take full advantage of the features provided by Drifter, make sure you
are using one of the supported Unity versions listed above.

### Installation Steps

1. Import the Drifter library into your project.
2. Import the relevant Unity module from Drifter that suits your project requirements.
   Hereâ€™s the refined section with the installation steps incorporating the code snippets:

### Installation Steps

1. Import the Drifter library into your project.

   For more details, view the [implementation guide](releases/implementation.md).

2. Import the relevant Unity module from Drifter that suits your project requirements.

   For example, to implement the Drifter Unity module for `v2022.3.7f1`, add the following
   dependency:

   ```kotlin
   dependencies {
      implementation("dev.teogor.drifter:drifter-unity-2022-3-7f1:$version")
   }
   ```

3. Set up your `Application` class to initialize Drifter with the appropriate Unity version.

   Update your `Application` class as follows:

   ```kotlin
   class DemoApplication : Application() {

     override fun onCreate() {
       super.onCreate()

       // Initialize Drifter with the Unity factory for version 2022.3.7f1
       RegistryStartup.provides(withUnity202237f1Factory())
     }
   }
   ```

Alternatively, you can use `LocalUnityEngine` to provide the Unity factory:

   ```kotlin
   LocalUnityEngine provide Unity202237f1Factory()
   ```
